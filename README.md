# StudifyPro : One stop peer-to-peer learning

### Quality of working prototype (does it work) and potential of the prototype to be advanced to the next stage of development)

All seven features are working from the Front-End point of view. And yes, it's easy to extend the same code to the production level as we have followed the best practises for the code strcuture and deployment.

## User experience

We have followed the following principles of the user experience.

- Having a clear hierarchy.
- Three click principle.
- The user is in control for all their actions.
- Keeping the UI Consistent across the platform.
- Maintained the accessibility across the complete platform.

## Code quality

We have maintained the code quality across the project. We have used the ~.eslint for the project and have maintained it across the code structure.

## Architecture

We have included all seven tasks and their actual UI Implementation. We have build everything on the **ReactJS**

## Usage of design patterns

We have added following design patters in the project :

- HOC Pattern - We have implemented the High Order Component patterns to fix the desingn pattern for the Root component.
- Provider pattern been useful to maintain the global state for the complete react app.

## Installation

Step 1: Git clone the project onto your local repository.

`git clone https://git.cs.dal.ca/kvaghani/studifypro`

Step 2: Next step is to run the installation of the npm modules using the following command :

`npm install`

Step 3: Once you see that modules are installed successfully, you can run the project using the following command.

`npm install`

Step 4: You can check and view the react UI.

## Performance optimization techniques used in the project

We have implemented the modules to optimize the cache on the browser. We have also made sure the minimum space comsumption when deadling with the Arrays or Data strctures in the react code.
